# campus-bazaar
Campus Bazaar is a buy-and-sell platform for college students, featuring separate Buying and Selling sections. Users can list products with images, descriptions, and contact details, while buyers can view item details in an expandable popup. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, it uses localStorage to save listings.
